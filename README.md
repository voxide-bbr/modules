# Battle Bit modules
Voxide's modules folder for RainOrigami's API Runner.

## Main branch
This branch is deployed to the production battle bit api.
[main branch](/voxide-bbr/modules/tree/main)

## Staging branch
This branch is deployed to the development battle bit api.
[staging branch](/voxide-bbr/modules/tree/staging)

## Development branch
Not implemented. I recommend making feature branches & submitting pull requests. If you need to test, it would have to be put into staging since there is currently no locally hosted battle bit servers allowed.
